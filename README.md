# DataCamp Data Science Projects
Repository containing projects completed during DataCamp courses.

#### Guided Projects
[Netflix_Movie_Length_Analysis.ipynb](/Netflix_Movie_Length_Analysis.ipynb) demonstrates a simple analysis of Netflix movie lengths through time, broken down by the type of movie. The dataset is filtered and then matplotlib is used to display the results.

[Google_Play_App_Analysis.ipynb](/Google_Play_App_Analysis.ipynb) shows a simple analysis of factoring affecting the apps downloaded through Google Play, such as price, and rating, category.

[GitHub_History_Scala.ipynb](/GitHub_History_Scala.ipynb) Analysis of the Scala repository, looking at recent pull requests and developer contributions.

[Nobel_Prize_Winners.ipynb](/Nobel_Prize_Winners.ipynb) analyses the winners of the Nobel Prize, with visualizations of where winners are from, their gender, and their age.

[Handwashing_Analysis.ipynb](/Handwashing_Analysis.ipynb) analyses handwashing data from clinics in 19th century Germany to demonstrate that handwashing reduces mother mortality after giving birth. Bootstrapping of the mean proportion of deaths is employed to estimate the confidence interval of the reduction in mother mortality after handwashing is mandated.

[Predicting_Credit_Card_Approvals.ipynb](/Predicting_Credit_Card_Approvals.ipynb) analyzes data on the approvals and denials of credit card applicants. First the data is preprocessed for missing values, categorical data are converted to numerical dummy variables, and data are rescaled. Then a logarithmic regression is employed with cross validation to create a model to predict approvals and denials.
